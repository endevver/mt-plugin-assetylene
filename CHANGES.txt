# Version 1.01 - May 1, 2009 (byrnereese)

    * Making small change to the size of the caption box so that it does not
      disrupt the asset options dialog so much.

    * Fixed bug in which many of the variables (img_src, etc) were not
      properly being set, and added an onfocus javascript hook for the
      caption textarea.
